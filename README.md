# daily work worker
The daily work worker does the daily work for you.
Just a little backup here, a small system update there. 
All the stuff you should do on a daily bases.

I use this for ```Linux 5.8.6-1-MANJARO x86_64 20.1 Mikah```

# Status
Pretty raw, pretty much work in progress.
Use it if you understand it, if not wait for a more elaborated status.
